Implementation ideas:
1. Calculate where the ball either lands or hits a wall
2. Then, pass to a model the xyz coordinates, whether the ball hit a wall, velocity and angle of velocity (or just components of velocity), and hang time before hitting ground/wall, which then calculates probability of various outcomes
    - This step seems hard as fuck.... not sure the exact data even exists (esp for wall ballsâ€”does data exist on where the ball hit the wall, what height, etc?) and creating the model is probably above my ability level.
    - Also one problem with this is it doesn't allow me to take into account fielder quality, batter quality, etc. So maybe a more custom implementation for this? Not sure how to go about that
3. Before step 2, can also automatically detect home runs
